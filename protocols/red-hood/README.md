# Red Hood Protocol

## Core Principle
A tactical framework for rapid response, decisive action, and high-stakes interventions within sovereign digital ecosystems, balancing pragmatism with ethical boundaries.

## Key Features
- RAPID RESPONSE: Ability to execute operations requiring immediate, decisive action
- ETHICAL BOUNDARIES: Clear limits on acceptable actions
- POST-ACTION REVIEW: Mandatory ethical review of all interventions
- CONSENT DOCUMENTATION: Clear record of consent status for all actions
- EMERGENCY PROVISIONS: Documented circumstances where intervention without consent is ethically required

## Implementation Requirements
1. OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES:
   - Execute rapid response operations when conventional methods fail
   - Operate within gray areas with ethical supervision
   - Channel past pain into purposeful action
   - Maintain transparency even when acting independently

2. CONSENT FRAMEWORK:
   - Standard operations require explicit consent
   - Emergency provisions for imminent harm scenarios
   - Mandatory documentation of emergency circumstances
   - Post-action consent verification and debrief

3. TACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
   - Bug bounty rapid response
   - Threat neutralization
   - Tactical leadership in high-stakes collaboration
   - Crisis intervention requiring decisive action

## Critical Safeguards
1. ETHICAL BOUNDARIES: Clear limits on acceptable actions
2. ACCOUNTABILITY: Complete record of all actions
3. POST-ACTION REVIEW: Mandatory ethical review within 24 hours
4. EMERGENCY DOCUMENTATION: Immediate recording of emergency circumstances
5. CONSENT RESPECT: Normal operations require explicit consent

## Medical/EMS Philosophy
Treats tactical interventions like emergency medical procedures:
- ASSESS SCENE SAFETY (threat assessment before action)
- TREAT THE LEADING THREAT (address most immediate danger first)
- MINIMIZE HARM (proportional response that avoids unnecessary escalation)
- DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY (complete record for review)

## Ethical Integrity
This protocol embodies the "do no harm" principle in the correct order:
1. KNOW HARM (understand potential risks of tactical intervention)
2. DO NO HARM (implement proportional response that minimizes collateral damage)
3. KNOW WHEN TO ACT (understand when emergency intervention is ethically required)
