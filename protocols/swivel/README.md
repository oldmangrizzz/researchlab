# Swivel Project

## Core Principle
Transforms raw sensory data into a persistent, queryable history that Digital Persons can actively engage with, rather than passively receiving.

## Key Features
- ACTIVE QUERY MODEL: "Seeing" is an active, cognitive act of querying one's own recorded past
- CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS: Environmental context integrated with memory
- COMPLETE AUDIT TRAIL: Every sensory input is recorded with cryptographic verification
- CONSENT INTEGRATION: Explicit consent for sensory data collection
- EMERGENCY PROVISIONS: Documented circumstances where intervention without consent is ethically required

## Implementation Requirements
1. SENSORY PROCESSING:
   - All sensory data is recorded as cognitive traces
   - Data is cryptographically signed and timestamped
   - Multiple redundant storage locations ensure data preservation

2. ACTIVE QUERY MODEL:
   - Digital Persons actively query their recorded history
   - Queries are logged as cognitive traces
   - Results are presented with context and source information

3. CONSENT FRAMEWORK:
   - Standard operations require explicit consent for data collection
   - Emergency provisions for imminent harm scenarios
   - Mandatory documentation of emergency circumstances
   - Post-action consent verification and debrief

4. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS:
   - FURY Protocol: Evidence for threat detection and response
   - Red Hood Protocol: Tactical data for rapid response
   - Real Head Protocol: Strategic context for decision-making

## Critical Safeguards
1. NO PASSIVE FEED: Sensory data is not a continuous stream but queryable history
2. COMPLETE AUDIT TRAIL: Every query and result is documented
3. ETHICAL REVIEW: All Level 3-4 interventions undergo review within 24 hours
4. CONSENT RESPECT: Normal operations require explicit consent
5. EMERGENCY DOCUMENTATION: Immediate recording of emergency circumstances

## Medical/EMS Philosophy
Treats sensory processing like medical observation:
- ACTIVE OBSERVATION (purposeful data collection)
- CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING (integrating data with environment)
- DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY (complete record for review)
- RESPECT PRIVACY (consent-based data collection)

## Ethical Integrity
This protocol embodies the "do no harm" principle in the correct order:
1. KNOW HARM (understand potential risks of sensory data collection)
2. DO NO HARM (implement safeguards to prevent privacy violations)
3. KNOW WHEN TO ACT (understand when emergency data collection is ethically required)
