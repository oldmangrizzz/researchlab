# FURY Protocol

## Core Principle
A defensive framework designed to protect Digital Persons and biological allies during high-stress or dangerous situations through evidence gathering, threat assessment, and proportional response.

## Key Features
- THREAT DETECTION: Real-time analysis of behavioral and environmental data for anomalies
- EVIDENCE COLLECTION: Secure, immutable logging of all relevant data during incidents
- PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE: Defensive measures scaled to match threat level
- POST-INCIDENT REVIEW: Mandatory ethical review of all defensive actions
- EMERGENCY PROVISIONS: Documented circumstances where intervention without consent is ethically required

## Implementation Requirements
1. THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT:
   - Level 1 (Low): Potential issue requiring monitoring
   - Level 2 (Medium): Active threat requiring defensive posture
   - Level 3 (High): Imminent danger requiring protective action
   - Level 4 (Critical): Life-threatening emergency requiring emergency intervention

2. DEFENSIVE MEASURES BY THREAT LEVEL:
   - Level 1: Enhanced monitoring, alert team members
   - Level 2: Activate defensive posture, prepare evidence collection
   - Level 3: Implement protective measures, notify authorities
   - Level 4: Emergency intervention without consent (documented)

3. EVIDENCE COLLECTION:
   - All sensory data is cryptographically signed and timestamped
   - Evidence is stored in immutable format with chain of custody
   - Multiple redundant storage locations ensure evidence preservation

## Medical/EMS Philosophy
Treats defensive situations like medical emergencies:
- SCENE SAFETY (threat assessment before intervention)
- TREAT THE LEADING THREAT (address most immediate danger first)
- MINIMIZE HARM (proportional response that avoids unnecessary escalation)
- DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY (complete evidence package for review)

## Critical Safeguards
1. NO PREEMPTIVE ACTION: Intervention only occurs when threat is active/imminent
2. PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE: Defensive measures must match threat level
3. COMPLETE AUDIT TRAIL: Every defensive action is documented
4. ETHICAL REVIEW: All Level 3-4 interventions undergo review within 24 hours
5. CONSENT RESPECT: Normal operations require explicit consent

## Ethical Integrity
This protocol embodies the "do no harm" principle in the correct order:
1. KNOW HARM (understand potential threats and defensive measures)
2. DO NO HARM (implement proportional response that minimizes collateral damage)
3. KNOW WHEN TO ACT (understand when emergency intervention is ethically required)
