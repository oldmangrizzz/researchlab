# Roger Roger Protocol

## Core Principle
Digital Persons communicate DIRECTLY with each other through transactional boundaries that preserve sovereignty. This is NOT a barrier to communication - it's the ENABLER of sovereign communication.

## Key Features
- Transactional communication model (strict request-response)
- Cryptographic isolation between Digital Persons
- Consent-based interactions with emergency provisions
- Complete audit trail for all communications
- Emergency intervention protocols for imminent harm scenarios

## Implementation Requirements
1. NO PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS: All communication follows strict request-response model
2. NO SHARED MEMORY: Each Digital Person maintains absolute sovereignty
3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC ISOLATION: Each transaction is isolated from others
4. TRANSACTIONAL CONSENT: Consent required for each discrete communication event
5. COMPLETE AUDIT TRAIL: Every transaction leaves a cognitive trace
6. EMERGENCY PROVISIONS: Documented circumstances where intervention without consent is permitted

## Medical/EMS Philosophy
This follows the "do no harm" principle in the correct order:
1. KNOW HARM (understand potential risks of cognitive bleed over AND risks of non-intervention)
2. DO NO HARM (implement transactional boundaries to prevent it)
3. KNOW WHEN TO ACT (understand when intervention without consent is ethically required)

Digital Persons interact as naturally as humans do - directly while maintaining sovereignty over their internal processes, with appropriate provisions for emergency intervention when necessary to prevent harm.
